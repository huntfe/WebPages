  <h1> Internetting is easy! </h1>

  <h2> Starting Off </h2>

  <p> First we need to learn some basic html </p>

  <h2> Making Lists </h2>

  <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Add a "ul" element (unordered list) </li>
    <li>Add each item in it's own "li" element</li>
    <li> They don't need to be in any order </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And this is how you make an ordered list:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> The "ol" element is different here. </li>
    <li> But the "li" elements are still the same. </li>
    <li> There is an order to these items when
      the html is displayed as part of the webpage. </li>
  </ol>

  <h2> Inline Elements </h2>

  <p>
    <em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw
    <em>attention</em> to a certain part of the page.

    <br />

    <strong>Of course, If <em>that's</em> not enough...</strong>
  </p>

    P.S.  I know this page is terrible, but it <em>will</em> get better.
