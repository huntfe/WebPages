        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>

        <p class="synopsis">CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in a document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.</p>

        <p>Classes are ridiculously inportant, since they allow you to select arbitrary boses in your web pages. <br /> The naming convention is all lowercase with hyphens for spaces. Also, name the class based on what the html element is doing, it makes it less confusing if you change what the CSS is doing.</p>

        <p>We'll also be talking about links in this example, so here's <a href="https://internettingishard.com">Internetting is hard</a> for us to style. Here's a link to <a href="#button2">button 2</a>. This is a link to a URL fragment, which means it goes to a specific part of the page adding a # and an ID to the end of the URL.</p>

        <a class="button" href="nowhere.html">
            Button One
        </a>

        <a id="button2" class="button callToAction" href="nowhere.html">
            Button Two
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="sidebar">
        <p>If this page had a sidebar...</p>
        <p>We'd have problems.</p>
