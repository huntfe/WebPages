    <h1>Links</h1>

    <p>
      This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.
    </p>
    <p>This page is about links. There are three kinds of links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Absolute Links
        <ul>
          <li>
            The most detailed way to refer to a web resource, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target="_blank">
              Mozilla Developer Network</a>
              , which is a good resource.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Relative Links
        <ul>
          <li>
            These point to a file in the same website and the
            same directory as the current file.
            The scheme and domain are implied to be the same.
            Like to the <a href="misc/extras.html">Extras page</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Root-Relative Links
        <ul>
          <li>These links are relative to the root URL of the website.
              This does mean that without a server these can't be used.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>It is also possible to get to parent folders by using the .. syntax.
          This can be seen in action in the <a href="misc/extras.html">Extras page.</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
