    <h1>Images</h1>

    <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a href="links.html">links</a> and <a href="misc/extras.html">useful extras</a>. </p>

    <h2>JPGs</h2>

    <p>JPG images are good for photos. They keep file sizes small, but they don't have transparent pixels so they are not as high quality as a png image.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble." />

    <h2>GIFs</h2>

    <p>GIFs are <strike>good for animations</strike> my life.</p>

    <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="A dancing mochi." />

    <h2>PNGs</h2>

    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons. They do not limit the colour palette so they show images more faithfully. This also means that they are larger than JPGs</p>

    <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="A mochi ball. (A bit boring if you ask me)" />

    <h2>SVGs</h2>

    <p>These are vector based images so they scale really well. Their issue is that they need any text fields to be converted to outlines.</p>
